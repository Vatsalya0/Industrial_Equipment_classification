# Industrial_Equipment_classification
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify industrial equipment into two categories: **defective** and **non-defective**. The model achieves high accuracy (98%) and automates the quality control process, enhancing efficiency and reducing manual efforts.
